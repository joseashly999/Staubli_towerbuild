# Staubli RX90 Tower Build Program
 This program uses the V+ programming language on Staubli RX90 industrial robot. The aim is to build a five layer high tower made from sticks. The robot has been taught four positions SAFE,PICKUP,XPOS and YPOS. The V+ program builds a tower from rectangular sticks where only two initial stick positions are known, XPOS and YPOS. The sticks are 9.7mm square and 50mm long, made from aluminium.  The robot needs to pickup a stick from the bowl feeder and place in postions until the tower is five layers high.



# Requirements
The code must be connected to the OS linked to the robot. Any changes in the V+ programming language can be done on a notepad
